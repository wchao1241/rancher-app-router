# CoreDNS

### How to use

```
$ docker-compose -f ./etcd-compose.yaml up -d
$ docker-compose -f ./rdns-compose.yaml up -d
```

### Add test records

```
$ etcdctl rm /rdns/local/rancher/test/zhibo/x1 '{"host":"1.1.1.1"}'
{"host":"1.1.1.1"}
$etcdctl set /rdns/local/rancher/test/zhibo/x2 '{"host":"2.2.2.2"}'
{"host":"2.2.2.2"}
```

Use dig for test:

```
dig @<coredns-address> zhibo.test.rancher.local A

; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> @172.22.100.5 zhibo.test.rancher.local A
; (1 server found)

;; ANSWER SECTION:
zhibo.test.rancher.local. 160	IN	A	2.2.2.2
zhibo.test.rancher.local. 160	IN	A	1.1.1.1
```


### Add ns records

For DNS to work properly SkyDNS needs to tell its parents its nameservers.

```
etcdctl set /rdns/cloud/rancher/lb/dns/ns/ns1 '{"host":"ip1"}'
etcdctl set /rdns/cloud/rancher/lb/dns/ns/ns2 '{"host":"ip2"}'
```

## Backup and Restore

### Dependencies

> etcdctl installed.

> AWS S3 bucket.

> AWS access and secret key with write permissions for this bucket.

### Backup data to S3

>1. Modify fields in "backup_etcd_s3.sh", such as "s3-bucket", "s3-region", etc.

>2. Reference script "backup_etcd_s3.sh", and use crontab to perform, such as copy to `/etc/cron.daily/`

### Restore data from S3

>1. Make public the backup files.

>2. In "restore_etcd.sh" script file,change the "BACKUP_V2_SUFFIX" and "BACKUP_V3_SUFFIX" fields according to the file you want to restore.

>3. Execute "restore_etcd.sh" script file.
